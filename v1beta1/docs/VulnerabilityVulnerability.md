**windows_details** | [**list[VulnerabilityWindowsDetail]**](VulnerabilityWindowsDetail.md) | Windows details get their own format because the information format and model don&#x27;t match a normal detail. Specifically Windows updates are done as patches, thus Windows vulnerabilities really are a missing package, rather than a package being at an incorrect version. | [optional] 
**source_update_time** | **datetime** | The time this information was last changed at the source. This is an upstream timestamp from the underlying information source - e.g. Ubuntu security tracker. | [optional]
